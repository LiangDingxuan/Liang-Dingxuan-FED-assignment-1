KYOURAN HEY KIDS!! Band website;
This is a website based on the japanese band KYOURAN HEY KIDS!! where it aims to be the bridge for western media to also enjoy KYOURAN HEY KIDS!! As the official website is currently only in japanese, by translating it to english as awell as allowing other global formats, it allows for more people to be able to access and read the website.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

Design Process
The target audience for the KYOURAN HEY KIDS!! Band website includes both existing fans of the band and potential new fans from the western audience. The goal is to provide an accessible and enjoyable platform for users to explore the band's music, news, live shows, and merchandise.
As a new visitor, I want to easily navigate through the website to discover information about the band and explore their music, so that I can become a fan.

As a fan, I want to stay updated on the latest news, live shows, and media appearances of KYOURAN HEY KIDS!!, so that I can actively follow their activities.

As a user interested in purchasing merchandise, I want a user-friendly interface to browse and buy goods easily, and have a seamless checkout process.

As a user looking for translated content, I want the band's bio and other Japanese text translated into English for a better understanding of KYOURAN HEY KIDS!! and their background.

Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

The checkout page was supposed to display image as well as name and price however the function for it was broken.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
