            <h5>Formed in Nara in 2010. A one-of-a-kind rock band that deftly manipulates sound and words without turning a blind eye to the dark side of humanity. Armed with live performances that highlight the members' characters, they appear at outdoor festivals across the country.</h5>
            <br>
            <h5>The released works are always breaking records, and the 5th AL 「SUCK MY WORLD」 released in April 2020 debuted at number 1 on Oricon following the previous work.</h5>
            <br>
            <h5>In June 2017, they held their first Nippon Budokan performance, and in February 2018, they held a performance at Osaka Castle Hall in their hometown of Kansai, both of which were sold out on the same day. From September 2018, they held a nationwide one-man tour 「Kisses and Kills Tour 2018-2019」 including 4 arena performances, and in May 2019 they held their first Asian tour 「KK Tour 2019 in Shanghai/Beijing/Taipei」. Then, in September, they held their first outdoor event 「PARASITE DEJAVU ~2DAYS OPEN AIR SHOW~」 at Osaka Izumiotsu Phoenix, which attracted approximately 40,000 people over two days.</h5>
            <br>
            <h5>Due to the spread of the 2020 novel coronavirus infection, COUPLING TOUR 2020 「Tonight the silence kills me with your fire」, JAPAN ARENA TOUR 「SUCK MY WORLD」, and Zepp Tour 「SUCK MY WORLD」 have been postponed or canceled in quick succession. However, in September, they held a 2-day performance called 「ORALIUM」 at KT Zepp Yokohama with a strong concept in mind. This performance once again demonstrated the importance of music during the coronavirus pandemic.</h5>
            <br>
            <h5>In 2022, they will hold their first national hall tour, Hall Tour 2022 「SUCK MY WORLD」, starting in February. Mobilizing approximately 30,000 people, the Tokyo performance showcased the band's wide range of musicality with a special formation that included a horn section and a chorus section.</h5>
            <br>
            <h5>In October of the same year, the sponsored event 「PARASITE DEJAVU 2022 ~2DAYS ARENA SHOW in SAITAMA~」 was held for two days at Saitama Super Arena for the first time in about three years. It mobilized approximately 30,000 people.</h5>
            <br>
            <h5>From February 2023, 2MAN VS TOUR 「MORAL PANIC」 will be held with 11 performances nationwide.</h5>
            <br>
            <h5>Their BKW!! (upset) spirit is causing a stir in the rock scene.</h5>
